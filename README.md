## What is this?
I was seeking a simple Kotlin server templating DSL that I could use for a simple project, 
[https://www.arseldrivingschool.com](https://www.arseldrivingschool.com). I found the obvious 
[kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html), but upon initial use, I found that it's API was clunky
and lacking in features that I needed (i.e. styles). I also found that other users identified 
[similar issues](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html/issues/31), and that no progress had been made for several years.
